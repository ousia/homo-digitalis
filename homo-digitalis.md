## What Is PDF?

PDF stands for “portable document format.” It has been developed by _Adobe_ for decades. It is _the portable document format_, and not simply another one. This is even based on the fact that “portable document format” is a trademark granted to _Adobe_ in many jurisdictions.

Leaving legal issues aside, PDF documents are known by average users as being specially suited for printing the file contents without any modification at all. In fact, many of these users even thinks that a PDF file is unalterable. They say PDF documents cannot be modified at all. Just for the record, unencrypted PDF documents can be modified also. Although editing them—you may want to use _LibreOffice Draw_ for this purpose—is not so easy as editing files in a word processor format.

The PDF format—I know there is an internal redundancy here, but I am going to leave it as is—is the standard in the printing industry. Your local copyshop may allow its customers even to print even large documents in any format format its computers can read. But professionals demand documents in PDF format. Or they will charge for text composition todo.

The average user understands that PDF may be understood as “printing document format”. And this basic perception captures the final purpose of the PDF is right. PDF is the best option when you want to print finished documents without any modifications—independent from the computer, operative system or printer used for printing.

## A Real Standard

Since _Adobe_ develops the PDF, many think that you can only generate and read PDF documents with _Adobe_ products. This would leave mainly _Adobe Reader_ and _Adobe Professional_—named _Acrobat Reader_ and _Acrobat Professional_ before.

But the previous statement isn’t simply true. Not only by the fact that there are other programs that allow PDF generation and display. There are many of them. The reason behind this colorful diversity is that PDF is a standard—the PDF 32000–1. _Adobe_ pushed for its first version and the second version is on the works. It is publicly accessible from its website containing references to its licensing policy.

Due to this practice, PDF has become the standard for printed matters in a networked world. Some professionals use _Adobe_ products for document generation, printing or display. Many other don’t use products from _Adobe_ and those . One of the best programs—not being a typesetting system itself—would be _Ghostscript_. The PDF standard is public. It isn’t open, because third parties may propose implementations to this standard. But _Adobe_ has the final word.
